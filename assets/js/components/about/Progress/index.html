            <p><strong>Planning</strong></p>

            <p>A Project Steering Committee and Operational Working Group comprised of National Treasury officials and representatives of IMALI YETHU was set up to provide strategic and operational guidance to the project. The Government Technical Advisory Centre was brought on board to support with the planning and project management of the project.</p>

            <p>A project planning phase was undertaken to scope the project, working together with Civil Society organisations. Thereafter, an open tender process was undertaken to secure a service provider to support the implementation of the project. In keeping with the partnership approach, Civil Society Organisations observed the procurement process. The tender was awarded to OpenUp. The official project commencement date was 4th August 2017.</p>

            <p><strong>Stage One</strong></p>

            <p>Stage one laid the foundation for the project. The Vulekamali name was chosen through a naming competition and the portal was official launched in February 2017 by the Minister of Finance.</p>

            <p>The Estimates of National Expenditure (ENE) and Estimates of Provincial Revenue and Expenditure (EPRE) documents and datasets were made available through the website during this stage.</p>

            <p>During stage one there were two hackathons and three Data Quests. The hackathons were held in Cape Town and Johannesburg and participants worked with the data available through the Vulekamali API.</p>

            <p>Data Quests were held in Tshwane, Cape Town and Mbombela. The Data Quests were designed to understand user needs in order to direct the development of the portal.</p>

            <p>Stage one also included a series of civic information events in Mpumalanga, where the Vulekamali project team introduced communities and local government to the vulekamali project and conducted workshops on budget analysis and advocacy.</p>


            <p><strong>Stage Two</strong></p>

            <p>Stage 2, which is version 4 of the data portal, builds on version 3 by adding other economic data and resources, while also updating it with the latest Estimates of National Expenditure (ENE), Adjusted ENE, Conditional Grant Frameworks &amp; Allocations, and Estimates of Provincial Expenditure (EPRE) data and improving the user experience based on user feedback. In response to user requests, the inclusion of explanatory guides on ENE and EPRE is also available on the Portal. In addition to this, version 4 provides links to relevant local and international economic and demographic datasets and data portals. Both the homepage, and Departmental Budget pages have also been improved. Along with the development done on vulekamali, three civic information drives were held in KwaZulu Natal, Eastern Cape and Northern Cape, These included a DataQuest and Hackathon in each of these provinces.</p>


            <p><strong>Stage Three</strong></p>

            <p>Stage 3, which is version 5 of the data portal, builds on version 4. A key feature as part of stage 4 is the <a href="https://procurement.vulekamali.gov.za/">Procurement guide</a> which aims to answer many questions citizens might have of the government’s procurement process. During Stage 4, there were several visual improvements made to the Department pages. Extensive work was done to include Provincial Infrastructure projects to bring further transparency in government spending, procurement. During stage three <a href="https://vulekamali.gov.za/videos">3 educational videos</a> were released on vulekamali. This took the overall number of educational videos to seven. A key focus of stage 3 was the release of <a href="https://vulekamali.gov.za/datasets/procurement-portals-and-resources">procurement information</a>. As with each stage, the project steering committee assess user feedback, some of these recommendations were included in the development process, i.e. improving vulekamali’s <a href="https://vulekamali.gov.za/faq">FAQ</a>, learning resources, the inclusion of in year monitoring information, Infrastructure project information. Along with all the development done on vulekamali, three civic information drives were held in Free State, Limpopo and finally, the North West Province. </p>

            <p><strong>Stage Four</strong></p>

            <p>Stage 4, which is version 6 of the data portal, builds on version 5. A key feature as part of stage 4 is the representation of budget information, geo spatially. As a user, you are now able to view the division of revenue by Province and Municipality, <a href="https://geo.vulekamali.gov.za/">https://geo.vulekamali.gov.za/</a>.
Adding visual improvements to vulekamali, like the Division of <a href="https://vulekamali.gov.za/learning-resources/guides/division-revenue-raised-nationally/">Revenue raised nationally</a>, though not directly part of stage 4, was a response to the project steering committee request to make this information more understandable to the user. This also speaks to geographic allocation of funds. During stage 4, a <a href="https://performance.vulekamali.gov.za/">guide to understanding government planning and performance management</a> was developed. During stage 4, South Africa experienced a national state of emergency announced by the President which resulted in a lockdown, due to the global CoronaVirus outbreak. Though the delivery of stage 4 remained on track, there were some additional features which had direct relevance to the virus. One of these features was including a dedicated section on the <a href="https://vulekamali.gov.za/covid-19-response/">R500 billion coronavirus response package</a> as indicated by the President. Similar to this, the Minister of Finance too, delivered a special adjustment budget speech, in response to the Coronavirus. Links to this were made accessible on the vulekamali homepage. With all the unexpected changes as a result of the Coronavirus, there has been an inclusion of various forms of information. Finally, a <a href="https://vulekamali.gov.za/covid-19-response/supplementary-budget-2020-21/">supplementary budget summary</a> page was added to help people find and understand this new information.</p>
