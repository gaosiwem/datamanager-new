# Progressbar

## `index.jsx`

Component that does the following:

 - adds custom styling to Material UI `<LinearProgress />` component.
 - Calculates progress based on string that is passed.

### Props

**⚠️The default `stage` of this component is set to `null` meaning that the progressbar will not render
